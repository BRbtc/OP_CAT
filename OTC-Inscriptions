# OTC NFT Trade Script

# Stack: [Alice's Signature] [Alice's Public Key] [Bob's Signature] [Bob's Public Key] [Alice's NFT ID] [Bob's NFT ID] [Expected Merkle Root]

# Assuming the Merkle tree verification logic you provided is already executed and the Merkle root is computed.

# Verify that the computed Merkle root matches the expected root
<R> OP_EQUALVERIFY

# Verify Alice's Signature
OP_DUP OP_HASH256  # Prepare Alice's public key for verification
3 OP_PICK         # Pick Alice's signature
2 OP_PICK         # Pick Alice's public key
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY # Verify Alice's signature

# Verify Bob's Signature
OP_DUP OP_HASH256  # Prepare Bob's public key for verification
5 OP_PICK         # Pick Bob's signature
4 OP_PICK         # Pick Bob's public key
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY # Verify Bob's signature

# Check if Alice's NFT ID is valid
OP_DUP OP_HASH256          # Hash Alice's NFT ID
7 OP_PICK                 # Pick Alice's NFT ID
OP_EQUALVERIFY            # Compare with hashed NFT ID
OP_DROP                   # Drop hashed NFT ID if equal

# Check if Bob's NFT ID is valid
OP_DUP OP_HASH256          # Hash Bob's NFT ID
6 OP_PICK                 # Pick Bob's NFT ID
OP_EQUALVERIFY            # Compare with hashed NFT ID
OP_DROP                   # Drop hashed NFT ID if equal

# At this point, the script has verified signatures and NFT IDs.
# The parties can add additional logic for transferring cryptocurrency or exchanging NFTs.

# Example: Transfer cryptocurrency from Alice to Bob
# [Amount] [Alice's Public Key] [Bob's Public Key] 2 CHECKMULTISIG
